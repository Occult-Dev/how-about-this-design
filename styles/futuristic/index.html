						<strong><em>Brutalism, Minimalism, Vaporwave, Retro, Futuristic...</em></strong> Thereâ€™s so many design styles out there it can be tough to stay on top of them all!
						<br><br>
						Here at <strong>How About This Design?</strong> we help you choose your next great design by showing you real-world examples of various different design styles. Choose a style from the menu below, and watch this site morph right before your eyes!
						<br><br>
						The content of the site stays <em>mostly</em> the same, it just shifts around, changes palettes, and gets a bit aesthetically funky.<br>
						At the bottom of this page are examples from various categories (<em>product design, banners, merch, etc.</em>) that showcase a more specific breakdown of your chosen style.
						<br><br>
						<strong><em>We hope you find this useful!</em></strong>

					<h1>About This Design:</h1>
					<!-- CHANGE THE TEXT BELOW TO INFORM THE USER ABOUT YOUR DESIGN, FEEL FREE TO STYLE IT HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE -->
					<p>
						The word <strong>Futuristic</strong> holds the meaning of something that's advanced or something that is 
						way ahead of its time. Meaning that Futuristic design should give the user a taste of how the future could turn
						out to be. 
						<br><br>
						The future could be many things. It could be a future of hi-tech advancements, human settlements in Mars or 
						any other positive Futuristic outlooks we could think of. Or it could be painted as the apocalypse. Dark, eerie, 
						filled with zombies or AI robots who take over our planet. In the end, when we think of futuristic design, 
						and tech in general, images of the Matrix, Black Panther come to mind.
						<br><br>
						Incorporating these images into design, most of us tend to think of a design that's clean, simple yet captivating with 
						sleek animations and a high responsiveness.
