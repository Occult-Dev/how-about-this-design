		<h1>About This Design:</h1>
		
		<p>
			Vaporwave is a music genre, and art style that emerged in the early 2010's. It draws heavy inspiration from the 80's, and 90's.
			<br><br>
			<b>It's all about the a e s t h e t i c s.</b> You'll often find that vaporwave art has a very particular type of style.
			it usually involves consumer products from the 80's, Roman busts and sculptures, and chill/cool colors, such as teal or neon pink. You'll also find
			that images of communism i.e Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, are heavily incorporated in the style as well. Another thing you'll notice is
			various types of Japanese imagery. This includes Japanese text itself, anime, or culture.
			<br><br>
			<b>Polygons, wireframes, and everything in between.</b> As mentioned above, Vaporwave draws heavily from 80's art. Part of that
			of course, is the 3d technology of the time. You'll often see faces and plains with sunsets that use wireframe.
			<br><br>
			<b>The degradation of the past.</b> Another staple in the vaporwave style is generation loss. This refers to when a VHS tape has
			been played so many times, that the quality of the image degrades. You'll see this type of effect, in combination with glitchy patterns.
