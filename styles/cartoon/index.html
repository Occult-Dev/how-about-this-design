				<strong><em>Brutalism, Minimalism, Vaporwave, Retro, Futuristic...</em></strong> There’s so many design styles out there it can be tough to stay on top of them all!
				<br><br>
				Here at <strong>How About This Design?</strong> we help you choose your next great design by showing you real-world examples of various different design styles. Choose a style from the menu below, and watch this site morph right before your eyes!
				<br><br>
				The content of the site stays <em>mostly</em> the same, it just shifts around, changes palettes, and gets a bit aesthetically funky.<br>
				At the bottom of this page are examples from various categories (<em>product design, banners, merch, etc.</em>) that showcase a more specific breakdown of your chosen style.
				<br><br>
				<strong><em>We hope you find this useful!</em></strong>

			<p>
				Cartoon style can bring a eye-catching uniquess to a website. It incorporates illustrative elements  such as wacky characters and colorful backgrounds that gives off a fun and fantasical vibe. This style is versatile in that illustrations can range from a exaggerated caratiure style to a semi-realistic style.</p>
