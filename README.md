**Minimalism, Brutalism, Vaporwave, Retro, Futuristic...** *Thereâ€™s so many design styles out there it can be tough to stay on top of them all!*

Here at **How About This Design?** we help you choose your next great design by showing you real-world examples of various different design styles. Choose a style from the menu, and watch the site morph right before your eyes!

Design styles are helpful to nail down the look for your website, app, game, or startup. You can either fully adopt a style, or get inspired to mix & match your favorites. **How About This Design?** simply shows you an real-world example of these styles so you can get a better feel of how they look when applied to a product.

# How Do I contribute?
If you're a designer, developer, web-dev, whatever-dev, then you're at the right place. Simply fork this repo, create a new **style** in the `styles` folder, and then open up a pull-request. **Simple as that!**

What kind of **style** should you create? Whatever you'd like! **Just avoid duplicating any pre-existing styles that have already been submitted & approved.** Take a look at the pre-existing styles to see what others are doing & get inspired. Also, google-searching & pintrest are you friends for design mood~boards!

#### I recommend checking out the `minimal` folder inside the `styles` folder to get an example of how to create a new style

### A Few Things To Note While Creating Your Style:
- **ADD YOUR DESIGN IN ITS OWN FOLDER:** *Inside the `styles` folder, make a new folder named after the style you are submitting. This folder is where you should place your files.*
- **KEEP YOUR FILES TO A MINIMUM:** *Just use a main `index.html` & `style.css` file. If you must, **must**, use some javascript-magic for your design style to work, then you may also include a `script.js` file & any neccessary libraries. Additional resources, such as images, are at your discreation of where to add, how to display, and how many to use.*
- **BE CLEAR IN YOUR PULL-REQUEST:** *Don't just sumbit a PR and call it a day, please. You should explain what style you are submitting, and any links to examples or articles discussing the style are greatly appreciated and can help get your PR merged quicker!*
- **KEEP THE MAIN CONTENT THE SAME:** *The "main" content of the site should stay the same. When forking this repo, copy the template `index.html` file in the root directory, this will help you know which content should remain, and which content you are free to modify & customize to your specific style.*
- **TAG YOUR ISSUES APPROPRIATELY:** *We have tags for bugs, typos, questions, and misc. Use em' or... lose em'! ...Or something like that...*

**Hey did you know that the main homepage for this site is pretty ugly & boring?**
Yup, that's the point! The base homepage is devoid of any style, just plain ol' HTML. This is because this is meant to act as a "blank slate" for future design style contributions
